<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="container_access">Volume Mgmt</span></h3>
<p>
  Docker has a variety of different approaches for data storage.  Each has their drawbacks so you decide.
  <ul>
    <b>Storage in a container</b>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    Storage in a container is quick and dirty however when you delete the container the data is lost.
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <b>Storage to a volume</b>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    Stores to the host disk for persistence however you are now tied to that host so portability suffers.
    A volume is subdirectory in a containerâ€™s file system that exists outside of the union file system.
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <b>Storage to a container volume</b>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    Volume containers are better but backups to the host disk still need to be considered.
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <b>Storage to NAS, NFS, etc. with volume plugin</b>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    Vendor plugins allow for integration into your network storage environment with all of it's benefits.
    Your also exposed to all the vendor issues we know and love.
  </pre>
